# Getting Started

There are a couple of ways to get started with the Yelken.
Firstly, If you want to use and experiment with Yelken quickly, [Playground](/getting-started/playground.md) documentation is correct place to start for you.

You can also easily spin up a Yelken instance on your local machine by following [hello-world](https://github.com/bwqr/yelken/tree/main/examples/hello-world) example.
This example contains a docker-compose file to setup a Postgresql database and Yelken instance with appropriate configuration.
You can check out other examples too to try the Yelken.

If you want to build Yelken manually and run locally, you can read the [Running Yelken](/getting-started/running-yelken.md) page which has necessary instruction to compile and bring up the Yelken.
