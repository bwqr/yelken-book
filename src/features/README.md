# Features

Yelken has a few features that enable you to organize the contents of your website, customize the appearance of the website, and work with other users as a team.
In this regard, [Content Management System (CMS)](./cms.md) is an important feature since users will spend most of their time with this one.
Inside this feature, there are **Model**, **Content** and **Asset** concepts that define the structure of your contents and make it possible to create new ones.

After defining the models for your contents, you can use [Appearance](./appearance.md) feature to design the appearance of your website with respect to these models.
You can easily define what to render at which URL path.
Moreover, you can install themes to easily use a predefined appearance.

As a last feature, [Adminstration](./administration.md) lets you manage various options of Yelken, such as supported locales and settings.
This feature also allows you to add new users and assign permissions and roles.
You can follow the corresponding section to learn much more detailed information about them.
